# Advanced Astronomy @ TJHSST — Public Assignments

This repository contains **public releases** of Jupyter-based homework assignments for the Advanced Astronomy courses at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST).

Assignments are released in a form suitable for student download and completion, and are organized by course:

- `aa_ss/` — *Advanced Astronomy: Solar System*
- `aa_u/` — *Advanced Astronomy: Universe*
- `aa_x/` — Shared material relevant to both courses

Each assignment appears in its own folder and includes:
- A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) containing instructions, problems, and code cells.
- Any necessary images or supporting files.
- No solutions, test code, or instructor metadata.

> 📁 Example:
> `aa_ss/ss_aristarchus/` contains `ss_aristarchus.ipynb` and a folder of images used in the assignment.
